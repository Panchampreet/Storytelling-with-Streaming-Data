In this assignment, I made use of the Times Newswire API, which is the official API from the New York Times.
With the Times Newswire API, you can get links and metadata for Times articles and blog posts as soon as they are published on NYTimes.com. The Times Newswire API provides an up-to-the-minute stream of published items.
The specific API among the collection of these APIs that I have used is one that retrieves the recent news from the database from the past hour upto 720 hours i.e. the past whole month.
The number of messages that I expect to have from a forever 'ON' stream of the API is very large, since every hour the API reports to get atleast 7 to 8 topics added to the backend.

In this assignment, I have made use of the Twitter streaming API to analyze the following properties about the data stream:
(i) The entropy of the tweets received.
(ii) The distribution of the tweets being received with the help of a histogram.
(iii) The probability of the influx of a message from a particular place.
(iv) The rate of the stream.

The flow of control in the app goes as follows:

python fetchTweetData.py | python
